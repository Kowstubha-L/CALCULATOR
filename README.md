# CALCULATOR
This project is a basic web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clean and intuitive design, with a display screen and buttons for each operation. CSS is used to style the layout and ensure the calculator is responsive. JavaScript handles the logic for performing calculations and updating the display in real-time.
